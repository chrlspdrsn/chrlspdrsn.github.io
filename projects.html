          <strong> Overview: </strong>Using Android Studio as a development platform and Java, myself along with two others worked to make a prototype application
          to help students manage homework, scheduling and classes. We aimed to implement:
          <ul> <strong>Learnability:</strong> simple to learn for first time users </ul>
          <ul> <strong>Memorability:</strong> easy to remember after not using app for a long time </ul>
          <ul> <strong>Efficiency:</strong> quick and effortless to perform tasks </ul>
          <ul> <strong>Satisfaction:</strong> surveys showed positive feedback for the app </ul>
          <ul> <strong>Accessibility:</strong> settings allow for changing visuals </ul>
          <strong>Roles:</strong> For the project, I was the project manager, created the home and tasks page, and developed our user
          testing. As project manager, I learned more about leadership through dividing roles and responsibilities among my team for
          the planning, execution and completion of the project. In addition, I learned a lot about Java, as well as general app
          development and design. Through the project, I thoroughly enjoyed working in a team setting. It made the project easier to
          tackle.

      <h3> BIOLA Language Compiler using C++ </h3>
      <p> In a course, Programming Languages, we covered various different languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Java, and
        Python. Our final project was to develop a program that successfully interprets the "BIOLA" langauge. We did so by creating
        the interpreter in C++ that reads the different tokens, identifies them as a display or read command, or as a variable. It
        then executes the program accordingly. Below are images of the source code, an example input and the compiled code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This program was very difficult to carry out. Through many hours of hard work, it taught me a lot of valuable programming
        skills, increased knowledge of C++, and grew my character.

      <h3> Debussy "Ballade" Piano Performance </h3>
      <p> In addition to my major and two minors, I have been studying Piano under Professor Manami Kawamura since Spring 2019 as
        an extracurricular. For my second semester, I memorized and performed Debussy's "Ballade". This piece was composed by French
        impressionist Claude Debussy in 1890, and spans around 7 minutes and 8 pages. It was incredibly challenging and even more
        rewarding to learn this piece. Below is a video recording from the Student Recital Concert.

        <div class="column right2">
          <p> Through this preparation and performance, I learned:
            <ul> <strong>Discipline:</strong> In order to successfully learn and perform a piece like this, the pianist must have
              discipline to train, practice and pay attention to the intricate details and technicalities within the piece. </ul>
            <ul> <strong>Perseverance:</strong> From consistent practice up until the end of the performance, I had to have
              perseverance to not give up when the song got difficult or, while performing, to not stop when I make a mistake. </ul>
            <ul> <strong>Confidence:</strong> I had to learn to have confidence in my ability when playing in front of an audience
              so that I could successfully perform. A pep talk at myself really helped with this one. </ul>
