      <h3> CREATIVE.</h3>
        <p> For as long as I can remember, creativity has been a driving force in my life. From a young age, I was
          fascinated by technology, music and creation. From piano to programming, originality and individuality have
          been characteristics that push me forward to explore new things, discover new ideas and see the world
          in a new light. Studying Computer Science has allowed me to take my logical and mathematical mind and
          combine it with my love for originality. Business Management has opened doors to creative thinking that
          would've been left untouched in my mind. Now, I continue to find creative solutions in day to day life,
          schoolwork, and work.

      <h3> PASSIONATE.</h3>
      <p> My passion for life, learning, and people has guided me to new depths of understanding. It has lead me into
        the natural world to explore its intricate details and unfathomable beauty. It has pushed me to take my
        knowledge and spread it through education and teaching. It has lead me to deep relationships and community.
        Computer Science explores my passion for logical reasoning, coupled with detail and problem solving. Stories
        bring the impossible to life, and teach me lessons about reality. Music transports my mind to another place.
        The things that matter to me are never far from my mind, and my passions lead me to new places everyday.

      <h3> DRIVEN.</h3>
      <p> The balance of efficiency, accuracy, and initiative I hold is unmatched. I have been recognized by professors,
        coworkers and peers alike for my unique drive for hard work. This has manifested itself in nominations,
        scholarships, and awards. I was chosen for my work ethic and character to work alongside three different
        professors as a teacher's assistant. My high school and college GPA's stood out from among my peers. I strive
        for the best, and never settle for less than what I am capable of.
